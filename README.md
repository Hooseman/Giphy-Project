#GiphyApp

##What is GiphyApp?
  GiphyApp is a fun web based application that allows you to choose from 25 gifs
  from whatever you search for, copy, and paste the gif wherever you please. Each
  search makes an HTTP request to giphy.com, and returns 25 gifs.

##Why GiphyApp?
  I use slack alot, and slack has a the ability to post gifs. But these gifs
  are random, and you cannot choose which gif you want. I decided to create this
  app to allow that. This was my first angular based application.

##Technologies Used:
  - Angular.js
  - JavaScript
  - Bootstrap
  - Firebase
